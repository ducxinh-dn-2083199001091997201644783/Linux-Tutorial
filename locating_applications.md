### Locating Applications
Depending on the specific distribution, programs and software packages can be installed in various directories. In general, executable programs should live in the following directories

```
/bin
/usr/bin
/sbin
/usr/sbin
/opt.
```

One way to locate programs is to employ the which ``utility``. For example, to find out exactly where the diff program resides on the filesystem:
```
$ which diff
/usr/bin/diff
```
If which does not find the program, whereis is a good alternative because it looks for packages in a broader range of system directories:
```
$ whereis diff
diff: /usr/bin/diff /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz
```
