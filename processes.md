###Linux processes
A **process** is simply an instance of one or more related tasks (**threads**) executing on the same machine. It is not the same as a program or a command; a single program may actually start several processes simultaneously. Some processes are independent of each other and others are related. A failure of one process may or may not affect the others running on the system. Processes use many system resources, such as memory, CPU cycles, and peripheral devices such as printers and displays. The operating system (especially the kernel) is responsible for allocating a proper share of these resources to each process and ensuring overall optimum utilization.

A terminal window, is a process that runs as long as needed. It allows users to execute programs and access resources in an interactive environment. You can also run programs in the background, which means they become detached from the shell. Processes can be of different types according to the task being performed.
