####Samba server and Windows file sharing
Samba is an open source implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol. It allows the networking of Microsoft WindowsÂ®, Linux, UNIX, and other operating systems. Samba allows a Linux/Unix server to appear as a Windows server to Windows clients.

With Samba, an administrator can do:

1. Serve directory trees and printers to Linux, UNIX, and Windows clients
2. Assist in network browsing with or without NetBIOS
3. Authenticate Windows domain logins
4. Provide WINS name server resolution

Samba is comprised of **smb**, **nmb**, and **winbind** services.

The ``smbd`` server daemon provides file sharing and printing services to Windows clients. In addition, it is responsible for user authentication, resource locking, and data sharing through the SMB protocol. The default ports on which the server listens for SMB traffic are TCP ports 139 and 445.

The ``nmbd`` server daemon understands and replies to NetBIOS name service requests produced by SMB in Windows-based systems. The default port that the server listens to for NMB traffic is UDP port 137.

The ``winbindd`` service resolves user and group information received from a server running Windows. This makes Windows user and group information understandable by Linux and UNIX platforms. This allows Windows domain users to appear and operate as Linux and UNIX users on a Linux or UNIX machine. Both ``winbindd`` and ``smbd`` are bundled with the Samba distribution, but the ``winbindd`` service is controlled separately from the ``smbd`` service.

####Setup a Samba server
We'll setup a Samba server to make Linux file sharing available to Windows clients. Install the Samba package, enable and start the ``smbd`` and ``nmbd`` services

```
# yum install samba
# systemctl enable smb
# systemctl enable nmb
# systemctl start smb
# systemctl start nmb
```

Samba uses ``/etc/samba/smb.conf`` as its configuration file. 

```
# mv /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.orig
# vi /etc/samba/smb.conf

# =============== Global configuration ===============
[global]
; Windows workgroup name and server description
workgroup = WORKGROUP
server string = My SMB Server %v
; NetBIOS name as the Linux machine will appear in Windows clients
netbios name = MYSMBSERVER
; interfaces where the service is listening: localhost and ens32 interfaces
interfaces = lo ens32
; permitted hosts to use the Samba server: localhost and all host belonging to 10.10.10.0/24 subnet
hosts allow = 127. 10.10.10.
; protocol version
max protocol = SMB3
; type of security
security = user
; DNS proxy
dns proxy = no

# =============== Shares configuration ===============
[share1]
comment = Private Documents
; path of files to share
path = /samba/admin/data
; users admitted to use the file sharing service
valid users = admin
; no guest user is admitted
guest ok = no
; make the share writable as Samba make it as readonly by default
writable = yes
; make the share visible as shared folder
browsable = yes

[share2]
comment = Public Documents
path = /samba/user2/data
valid users = user2 admin
guest ok = no
writable = yes
browsable = yes

[share3]
comment = Public Documents
path = /samba/user3/data
valid users = user3 admin
guest ok = no
writable = yes
browsable = yes
```

More than one user can be admitted to access the same share. In our case, the share1 is only accesible to the "admin" user. The share2 is accessible to "admin" and "user2" users but not "user3". The share3 is accessible to "admin" and "user3" to "user2".

**Note:** the connection to shares by the same Windows client needs to use the same user name. In our case, a Windows client can access all the shares above as "admin" but cannot access to share2 as "user2" AND access to share3 as "user3". If the Windows client needs to access with different users, it needs to logout from the previous user and then login again with a different user. Since Windows caches the login user, it needs to force the logout by issuing the command: ``net use * /delete`` from the Windows command shell

Samba uses different type of security. In the case above, the method is based on user level (default). With this method, each share is assigned specific users that can access it. When a user requests a connection to a share, Samba authenticates by validating the given username and password with the authorized users in the configuration file and the passwords in the password database of the Samba server.

Set the user password in the Samba password database

```
# smbpasswd admin
New SMB password:
Retype new SMB password:
#
```
The ``pdbedit`` command lists the Samba Users Database

```
# pdbedit -L
admin:1000:
user1:1001:
user2:1002:
user3:1003:
```

Other security methods are: Domain level security and Server level security.
