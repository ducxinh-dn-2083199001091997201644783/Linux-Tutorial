###Network interfaces
Network interfaces are a connection channel between a device and a network. Physically, network interfaces can proceed through a network interface card (**NIC**) or can be more abstractly implemented as software. You can have multiple network interfaces operating at once. Specific interfaces can be brought up (activated) or brought down (de-activated) at any time. A list of currently active network interfaces is reported by the ``ifconfig`` utility
